# My Portfolio WebSite

This is my personal portfolio — a central hub to showcase my work, development skills, and design approach as a web developer.

### Tech Stack

- Framework: React (with Vite) + TypeScript
- Languages: HTML / CSS / TSX
- Libraries & Tools: [Lenis](https://github.com/darkroomengineering/lenis) - smooth scroll library

### Design Style

- #### Neo-Brutalism / Brutalist Layout
Sharp lines, high contrast, raw grid structure with minimal decoration — intentionally bold and functional.

- #### Retro-Tech / Terminal Aesthetic
Inspired by early web interfaces and 90s computer systems. Monospaced and pixel-style fonts evoke a nostalgic, developer-centric feel.

- #### Japanese Typography & Pop Culture Influence
A visual nod to Cyberpunk 2077, Ghost in the Shell, Evangelion, and broader tech-anime aesthetics — adding personality and cultural identity.

### Goals & Focus

- Stand out with a visually distinct, personal style
- Emphasize technical and design skills equally
- Build a fast, responsive, and accessible experience
- Reflect my interests through layout and typography
